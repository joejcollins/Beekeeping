## 2020 Queen

2020-07-10 Laying nice dark looking queen.  Saw eggs and grubs.  Not a lot of stores.  Needs feeding.

2020-06-23 Only covering 2 frames, no signs of a laying queen but they do seem calm.  None of the frames was drawn enough for laying.

2020-06-17  Swarm collected from Little Stretton.
