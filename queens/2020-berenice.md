# Berenice
## 11 F
## 2020 Queen Marked

2021-05-01 Brood, eggs, saw the queen no signs of swarming.

2021-04-24 Found queen cells, so moved Berenice to one side (to the South), left the queen cells to start a new colony ([Wendy]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wendy.html)).  A lot of the flying bees appeared to just follow so they might have been in the mood to swarm.

2021-04-18 Brood, eggs, drones, drone comb, saw the queen, queen cups.  Lots of bees so I put on two supers.

2021-03-31 Brood in the top and bottom boxes.  About 5 frames of sealed brood, 3 frames of unsealed, some drone cells.  Saw the marked queen.  Nectar coming in.

2020-12-25 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment).

2020-10-06 Looks like they have stopped feeding, so took the rapid feeder off.

2020-09-19 Apiguard treatment off.

2020-08-22 Second Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-08 Started Apiguard treatment.

2020-07-31 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Marked the queen.  United on top of the frames from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html).

2020-07-24 Saw eggs and grubs didn't see the queen.

2020-07-17 Saw eggs and grubs, didn't see the queen.  They seemed pretty mobile on the frames.  It was a warm day.

2020-07-10 Laying nice dark looking queen.  Saw eggs and grubs.  Not a lot of stores.  Needs feeding.

2020-06-23 Only covering 2 frames, no signs of a laying queen but they do seem calm.  None of the frames was drawn enough for laying.

2020-06-17  Swarm collected from Little Stretton.
