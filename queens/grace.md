2019-06-18 Culled the drone brood. Saw the queen, saw eggs.  No signs of swarming.

2019-06-13 Saw the queen, saw eggs.  No signs of swarming.

2019-07-06 Saw the queen and marked her yellow.  A bit of paint got on her wing.  No signs of swarming.

2019-06-28 Saw brood and eggs.  Had a good hunt for the queen but didn’t see her.

2019-06-09 Loads of brood, loads of eggs.  Didn’t see the queen.

2019-06-02 There is a patch of normal sealed worker brood, it is a little bit uneven age wise, but I guess she is just finding her feet.  It was too windy to do a full inspection and actually find her but it looks like we are on line.  Also added a frame of sealed brood largely to deplete [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/kate/) a little bit.

2019-05-30 Small patch of brood on the frame North of the frame with the white pin.  Can’t tell if it is the result of a drone layer but there seemed to be more brood food that I would expect.  Not sure what is going on.

2019-05-25 Checked the queen cell, neatly opened. There are stores of both honey and pollen.  According to my schedule I should put in a frame of eggs.  Mags says no, I think she is right, it looks good so there is no point to interfering.

2019-04-25 Culled the queen cells down to one cell on the bottom (Southside) of frame marked with a white pin.

2019-04-18 Made up with 7 frames of brood from [Rachel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhHjKS5c_HKZsu1NNEyvZDKIFqx6f8HpBWs_Ql1dk7I).
