## 2010 Queen Green Marked

2019-09-14 Saw the queen, not much space for her to lay.  Put on a feeder because the frames I put in have been depleted.

2019-09-07 Checked and the queen is laying, looks like they could do with some more frames.

2019-08-27 Opened the door on the candy plug so the bees can start eating their way in.

2019-08-24 Created a nuc using a couple of frames of brood from on [Grace]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/grace/) and frames with stores.  Attracted the bees on to these frames through a queen excluder, just in case there is a queen in there (I am guessing only a 5-10 % chance).  Introduced a caged imported Carniolan queen.
