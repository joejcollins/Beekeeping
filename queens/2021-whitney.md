## 2021 Queen Cell marked with black pin

2021-06-12 Went through the brood box and culled the emergency cells.  There were about 20.  Left a single queen cell on the North side bottom of frame 4 (counting from the South).

2021-06-05 Made up with 11 frames from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) and removed Bethany to the side.
