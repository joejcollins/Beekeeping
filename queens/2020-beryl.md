## 2020 Queen Unmarked

2020-07-23 Saw eggs (not a lot of them, perhaps they are slowing up?), grubs but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.

2020-07-17 Queen cells but there are eggs and a lot of bees.  Couldn't find the queen.  Some queen cups, might be considering swarming?

2020-07-10 Lots of brood.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees.  The supers are filling.

2020-06-23 Checked for a laying queen, loads of brood, saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2020-06-02 Put on a clearer board to clear the top honey super.

2020-05-31 One honey super is ready to come off.

2020-05-21 Culled the queen cells, leaving one on the South side of one of the Northern frames marked with a black pin.

2018-05-14 Made up with 11 frames from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-Kate.html).  Nice looking queen cell on face of frame marked with a black pin.
