2019-08-15 Added second Apiguard treatment. 

2019-08-03 Saw the queen laying nicely, tidy brood pattern.  No signs of swarming.  They weren't using all the brood frames so I reduced them to 9 x 9.  Started the Apiguard treatment.

2019-07-22 Saw the queen and eggs.  Added another brood box from [Greta]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-greta.html) which was queenless.

2019-07-18 Open lower door on Snelgrove.

2019-07-14 Saw the queen and marked her, she is kind of small.  Put [Greta]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-greta.html) on top with a Snelgrove board between with a view to merging them at some point.

2019-07-13 Pissed off, but plenty of eggs and brood.  Didn't see the queen.  They need more space so I added 2 brood frames.  Put on a crystallized super to get them to eat the crystals.

2019-07-06 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html)).

2019-06-28 Saw brood and eggs.

2019-06-02 No signs of queen production.

2019-06-02 No signs of queen production but plenty of eggs.  They are drawing out the frames I put in.

2019-05-25 Put on 4 more frames and reconfigured to 7 x 7.

2019-05-23 Lots of bees, lots of stores, no place for the queen to lay.  Maybe more frame or try and bleed off some bee.

2019-05-11 Lots of bees, moved to the other side to bleed some off.

2019-04-25 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Gina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-gina.html)).

2019-04-18 No signs of swarming but loads of bees, added another super.

2019-04-07 Added a super.

2019-04-06 Lots of bees, brood on about 60% of the frames, saw eggs, the drone culling area will be ready next week.

2018-09-24 Apiguard off.

2018-08-11 Apiguard on.

2018-07-23 Checked and confirmed that the queen is laying.

2018-06-25 This lot swarmed.  I checked and there were other sealed queen cells which I culled (missed them first time round).  Still leaving the queen cell on bottom of frame 5 from the North.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-21 Sealed queen cell on bottom of frame 5 from the North.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-13  Culled the spare queen cells and a close pair of queen cells on the bottom of the middle frame.  One was charged and the other smaller one wasn't.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-07 There were emergency cells on the frames that I moved over from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  I shook the frames and took the emergency cells down.  Then put in a frame with eggs from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  The eggs are on the North side of the centre frame, for future reference.

2018-05-31 Queen cell has emerged.  Removed 3 empty frames and put them in [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  The frames of brood and went in at positions 5, 6 and 7.

2018-05-23 Only checked the supers which are getting full so I think they will need a fourth one.

2018-05-17 Culled the queen cells.  Left a single cell at the top of the frame North of the cull frame.  Marked with a red pin.  I am guessing we are at about day 8 so day 23 is 2018-06-01.  So I should check for eggs after that.

2018-05-10 Made up with 11 frames from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  Single queen cells with eggs marked with red, black and white pins.  A frame with a row of queen cells on the bottom marked with a blue pin
