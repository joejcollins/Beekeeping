## 2018 Queen Marked

2019-06-14 Added two brood frames bring them up to 20.

2019-06-13  Saw the queen and marked her yellow. No signs of swarming.  Need more space, there are a lot of bees in there.

2019-07-07 Put on another empty super to give them something to work on.  Added two brood frames to bring them up to 18 frames.

2019-07-06 Looked for the queen but couldn’t find her.  No signs of swarming but lots of bees, needs another super and a couple more brood frames.

2019-06-30 Took off the shit brood frames that had drones laid in them and distributed them to the other hives.

2019-06-28 Saw brood and eggs.  There are rubbish brood frames that had drone laying workers on them.

2019-06-22 Saw eggs but didn’t see the queen.  Not a lot of stores so I put on a feeder.

2019-06-02 Plenty of eggs, no obvious signs of queen production but there were some queen cups.  They are drawing out the frames I put in and there are a lot of bees.  I think it might be a good idea to swap them to the other side of the production hive.

2019-05-25 Put on 6 more frames and reconfigured to 8 x 8.

2019-05-23 Lots of bees, lots of stores, no place for the queen to lay.  Maybe more frame or try and bleed off some bee.

2019-05-11 Lots of bees, moved to the other side to bleed some off.

2019-04-25 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Greta](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRKHdvqu1g68dqyiOgjQyyH4yEW5tY-dWkMa5vTse7U/edit#)).

2019-04-18 No signs of swarming but loads of bees, added another super.

2019-04-07 Added a super.

2019-04-06 Lots of bees, brood on about 60% of the frames, saw eggs, the drone culling area was ready so I culled it.

2018-09-24 Apiguard off.  Supers on for drying.

2018-08-11 Apiguard on.

2018-08-09 Added frames from [Teresa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fydENvaHi7cSHfPJ7mx63xp3YwyTWhetBJGG4P_EB-E/edit) (which had a laying worker).

2018-08-06 Laying queen, doing well.

2018-06-30 Mags culled the queen cells down to one.  Don’t know if the frame was marked with a pin.  

2018-06-23 Found a couple of charged queen cells in [Sarah](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17JMVU8K3V4tgsD3z8VsTCRt44JlBsn0D08k39RdbU1U/edit#) so created this colony.
