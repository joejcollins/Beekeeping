## 2020 Queen Unmarked

2020-07-10 Lots of brood.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees in there.

2020-06-30 Lots of normal brood and grubs.  I didn't see eggs but I wasn't looking that hard and was just pleased that the brood looked normal.  Didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees and not much honey, I was going to shuffle the honey supers but the one that was full is now, not so full.

2020-06-23 Checked for a laying queen, saw eggs at the bottom of cells on frame 5 from the South.  I am not supposed to check for another week so this check is too early really.  Can't be certain things are right, but the eggs were singles at the bottom of the cells.

2020-05-27 Culled the queen cells down to one on the South face of a frame, second from the North end.  Marked with a pin.

2020-05-20 Made up with 11 frames from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html).  Marked two queen cells one on the bottom of a frame and one on the southern face of another frame.
