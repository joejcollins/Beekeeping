2020-08-22 Second Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-08 Started Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-04 Found one unsealed queen cell which I took down.  Reconfigured so the brood is in the bottom box and added a feeder.

2020-08-03 Removed the supers.

2020-08-01 Sealed queen cell and about 5 unsealed, queen still present and laying.  Strange, I think the queen cell might be some artifact because a couple of the frames were from a laying worker colony.  Also I can't be doing with a Demaree right now so I just took down the cells. Added brood box and more frames underneath.  Put on the clearer board so I can take the supers off.  Once those are off I can start feeding so the frames can be drawn out.

2020-07-24 Saw the queen, grubs and eggs.  It is a bit confused because there are a couple of droney combs from [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html) in there.

2020-07-19 Added frames and flying bees from [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html).

2020-07-17 Saw queen cells and eggs, had to hunt for the queen.  Marked her and put her in another box (on a Snelgrove board) on top of [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html).  If Brenda doesn't come good I will merge them.  Actually I might merge them anyway.

2020-07-10 Lots of brood.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees in there.

2020-06-30 Lots of normal brood and grubs.  I didn't see eggs but I wasn't looking that hard and was just pleased that the brood looked normal.  Didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees and not much honey, I was going to shuffle the honey supers but the one that was full is now, not so full.

2020-06-23 Checked for a laying queen, saw eggs at the bottom of cells on frame 5 from the South.  I am not supposed to check for another week so this check is too early really.  Can't be certain things are right, but the eggs were singles at the bottom of the cells.

2020-05-27 Culled the queen cells down to one on the South face of a frame, second from the North end.  Marked with a pin.

2020-05-20 Made up with 11 frames from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html).  Marked two queen cells one on the bottom of a frame and one on the southern face of another frame.
