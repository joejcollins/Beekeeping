## 11 F + 2 Crystallized Supers
## 2018 Queen (Marked Yellow)

2019-06-13 They aren't really clearing off the crystallized honey in the super.  However there is loads of young brood and bees on all the frames.

2019-06-07 Put on a crystallized super to get them to eat the crystals.

2019-06-05 Marked the queen yellow.  There were plenty of eggs.  United with 6 frames from a failed production/mating hive.

2019-06-29 Weak 5 frame nucleus from neighbor with 2018 queen, added 2 frames for stores and put on a feeder to build them up.
