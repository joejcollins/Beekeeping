## 2020 Queen

2020-06-13 No sign of eggs or the queen.  Still peevish.  I put in a frame of eggs and brood from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-Kate.html) to see it they make a queen.

2020-06-07 Saw the queen, she is brown like the rest of them.  No eggs and on the whole they were all a bit peevish.

2020-06-02 Found a clump of brown bees with a queen in on one of the other hives.  The hive with the swarm in was pissed when I opened it.  I am assuming that this is a mating flight or that the queen tried to swarm again yesterday.  I brushed the clump into a dust pan and shook them into the hive with the swarm.  They bees immediately started fanning at the entrance.  

2020-05-31 Swarm collected from Jeremy.  The bees are light banded brown.
