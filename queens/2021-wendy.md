## Opened Queen Cell

2021-06-05 Check for a mated queen.

2021-05-01 The queen cell on the bottom of the middle frame had recently popped, there was a little door on it.  There were shed loads of bees and another 10 or so queen cells.  One of the queen cells had been gashing in the side.  I am guessing that the new queen is still in there and it not ready to fly yet.  I took down all the queen cells in the hope she will mate from this hive.

2021-04-24 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).   Two unsealed queen cells on the bottom of the middle frame, marked with a red pin.
