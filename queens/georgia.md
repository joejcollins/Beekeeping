## Queen Cell

2019-07-29 Found a few cells with eggs in, the bees seem calmer.

2019-07-13 Culled the other queen cells to there is one queen cell on the north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.  Generally they seem pretty pissed off.  They look like they need more space so I added a brood frame.

2019-07-06 Unsealed queen cell (from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/kate/)) on north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.
