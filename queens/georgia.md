## 2019 Queen Unmarked 

2019-08-02 Queen laying nicely.  Increased the brood frames to 9 x 9 and put on a clearer board to try and squeeze them down into the brood box.  The plan is that they will draw this out and I might be able to treat with Apiguard.  There are quite a lot of bees so we'll have to see if we can get the supers off.

2019-07-29 Found a few cells with eggs in, the bees seem calmer.

2019-07-13 Culled the other queen cells to there is one queen cell on the north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.  Generally they seem pretty pissed off.  They look like they need more space so I added a brood frame.

2019-07-06 Unsealed queen cell (from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/kate/)) on north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.
