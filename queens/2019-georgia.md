## 2019 Queen Marked 

2020-05-08 Saw eggs and brood.  Didn't see the queen. There were drones and there were only a couple of patches of eggs in the 22 frames.  There were a number of cups but no charged cells.   No queen cells with grubs.

2020-05-02 Saw eggs and brood.  Didn't see the queen.  There are sections of drone brood waiting to come out (there isn't a cull frame).  The super isn't getting occupied.

2020-04-26 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  Lots of bee with most of the frames covered so I put on a honey super.

2020-04-22 Saw the queen, eggs, worker brood and sealed drone cells. No signs of queen rearing.

2020-04-16 Saw the queen and marked her.  One of her wings is stuck out so I don't expect she will be abel to fly.  Sas eggs, worker brood and sealed drone cells.  Continuing feeding because there are frames to draw out.

2020-04-06 Saw brood and eggs, didn't see the queen.  Put on a contact feeder with 1 to 1 syrup.

2020-03-22 Not seen on candy.  They are bringing in pollen.

2020-02-02 Not seen on candy.

2020-01-17 Tip weight including stand 12.5 kg, not seen on candy.

2019-12-23 Api Bioxal oxalic acid treatment using the trickle method.

2019-09-20 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2019-08-23 Second Apiguard treatment.

2019-08-11 Started the Apiguard treatment.

2019-08-02 Queen laying nicely.  Increased the brood frames to 9 x 9 and put on a clearer board to try and squeeze them down into the brood box.  The plan is that they will draw this out and I might be able to treat with Apiguard.  There are quite a lot of bees so we'll have to see if we can get the supers off.

2019-07-29 Found a few cells with eggs in, the bees seem calmer.

2019-07-13 Culled the other queen cells to there is one queen cell on the north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.  Generally they seem pretty pissed off.  They look like they need more space so I added a brood frame.

2019-07-06 Unsealed queen cell (from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-kate.html)) on north side of middle frame, marked with a red pin.
