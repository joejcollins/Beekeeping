\subsection{March: Early Feeding}

The most common reason for colony loss is starvation in March before enough feed is available.
A colony can sell for over Â£200 and 1 kg of sugar cost 65p.
Therefore provide feed anyway.
Allows raising of strong colony for queen raising and the early honey.

Feed early anyway, once the bees show through on the candy,
assume that are in need of feeding.

\begin{apiary}{Feed if necessary}
    \path (4,6) pic{roof=feeder};
    \path (4,4) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (4,2) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (4,0) pic{stand};

    \path (12,6) pic{roof=feeder};
    \path (12,4) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (12,2) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (12,0) pic{stand};

    \path (20,6) pic{roof=feeder};
    \path (20,4) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (20,2) pic{brood=8F};
    \path (20,0) pic{stand};
\end{apiary}
