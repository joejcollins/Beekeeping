## Queen Cell

2019-06-28 There was some strange swarm like behaviour in the yard which didn’t persist.  I think maybe there was a queen, but she could not get through the queen excluder.  Kind of a fuck up but I ununited.  

2019-06-27 Couldn’t find the queen cell so I think something has gone wrong.  United with [Kate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TKGf3dS0SmUamuOBg9lGNi6DWipNi1ftKixJmn-6bY/edit) with a queen excluder under it. 

2019-06-22 Queen cell (from [Sonja](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IroDTin9-z3FoxNmiyooipt3QSK6zB3gBGXhcHihJNs/edit#)) on North side of frame marked with a green pin. This colony had a laying worker so we shook out the bees in the sheep field.
